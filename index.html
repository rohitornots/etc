                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nuclear power generation is a key component of the global energy landscape, offering a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. At its core, it utilizes nuclear fission, where heavy atomic nuclei like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 split to release a tremendous amount of energy as heat. This heat produces steam, driving turbines connected to electricity generators. Since the mid-20th century, nuclear power has expanded globally, with over 400 reactors providing around 10% of the world's electricity and playing a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The advantages of nuclear power include its high energy density, meaning a small amount of nuclear fuel can produce significant energy, and its ability to provide a stable and reliable electricity supply. Nuclear plants operate continuously for long periods and produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making them attractive for climate goals. However, challenges include managing radioactive waste, high construction and decommissioning costs, and the potential risks of nuclear accidents, such as those seen in Chernobyl and Fukushima.

Advancements in technology, like small modular reactors (SMRs) and improved safety measures, are addressing many of these concerns. Despite the challenges, nuclear power remains a vital part of the energy landscape, with the potential to significantly contribute to a cleaner and more resilient energy future.</p>

                <h2>Nuclear Power Generation</h2>
                <p> Nuclear power plants utilize the heat produced by nuclear fission to generate steam, which then drives turbines to produce electricity. This fundamental process underlies all types of nuclear reactors, though specific reactor designs vary in how they manage and transfer the heat produced by fission. Among the most common types of reactors are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWR).

Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) are the most widely used type of nuclear reactor globally. In a PWR, water is used as both a coolant and a moderator, which helps slow down neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor core heats the water to extremely high temperatures, but the water is kept under high pressure to prevent it from boiling. This pressurized water then flows through a heat exchanger, where it transfers its heat to a secondary water loop. This secondary loop is at a lower pressure, allowing the water to boil and generate steam. The steam then drives the turbines to produce electricity. The primary advantage of the PWR design is the separation between the radioactive water in the reactor core and the steam that drives the turbines, reducing the risk of radioactive contamination in the turbine components.

Boiling Water Reactors (BWR), in contrast, have a simpler design where the water used to cool the reactor core is allowed to boil directly in the reactor vessel. This produces steam, which is then used to drive the turbines and generate electricity. In a BWR, the steam-water mixture produced in the reactor core is separated in a steam separator within the reactor vessel. The dry steam then exits the reactor and drives the turbines. One of the key benefits of the BWR design is its simplicity, which can result in lower construction and operational costs. However, because the steam that drives the turbines is in direct contact with the reactor core, there is a higher risk of radioactive contamination in the turbine components compared to PWRs.

Both PWRs and BWRs are critical to the current nuclear power landscape, each with its own set of advantages and operational considerations. PWRs are valued for their robust safety features and separation of radioactive materials, while BWRs are appreciated for their simpler design and potential cost efficiencies. As technology advances, both reactor types continue to evolve, incorporating new safety features and efficiency improvements to meet the growing demand for reliable, low-carbon energy. </p>
